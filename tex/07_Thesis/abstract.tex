At the end of the second decade of the XXI century, the transportation industry at large faces several challenges that will shape its evolution in the next decade and beyond. The first main challenge is the increasing public awareness and governmental action on climate change, which are increasing the pressure on the industrial sectors responsible for the greatest share of emissions, the transportation industry being one of them, to reduce their environmental footprint. A second challenge lies instead in the renewed push toward price reduction, due to increased competition (as for example the entry of private entities in the market for low-Earth orbit launchers) and innovative business models (like ride-sharing and ride-hailing in the automotive sector or low-cost carriers in civil aviation).\\
A common technical solution strategy to these challenges is the reduction of vehicles' structural mass, while keeping the payload mass constant. By reducing consumption, a reduced weight leads to reduced emissions in fossil-fuels powered vehicles and to increased autonomy in electrical vehicles. By reducing the quantity of materials required in structures, a weight reduction strategy favors a reduction of production costs and thus lower prices.
