I bought my first and current car, \emph{La Melanza}, in August 2015, just a few weeks before starting my doctoral studies at Lule\aa\ University of Technology and Universit\'e de Lorraine. Today, October 2019, the odometer reads kilometers. It has been indeed a long journey, one that has brought me to live in two different countries, France and Sweden, and to visit five more, Germany, Greece, Russia, Italy and Spain, for conferences, summer schools and exchanges. A journey in which I have learned a lot, made new friends and built a family. And, apparently, even managed to write a Ph.D. thesis! No such journey could be ventured alone, and here I would like to thank everyone who helped and supported me in these years.\\
It is common use to place supervisors at the top of the acknowledgements list, and I will not be any different. However, it is with sincere gratitude that I place them here in the first place. Thus, many thanks to Prof. Janis Varna for accepting me as his Ph.D. student, sharing his knowledge, correcting my mistakes, pointing my efforts in the right direction and always being passionate about research.\\[2.5cm]
