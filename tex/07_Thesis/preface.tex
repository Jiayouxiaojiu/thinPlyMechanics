The creation of this template has taken several years, and the shape it is in now would not have been possible with out the patient testers out there. To mention just a few who found and reported bugs, and occasionally even provided bug fixes: Gustav Johansson, Sara Sandberg, Yvonne Aitomäki, Fredrik Hägglund, Jesper Martinsson, Patrik Pääjärvi, and Martin Sehlstedt. To all of those I forgot to mention, please accept my apologies.\\[2.5cm]
