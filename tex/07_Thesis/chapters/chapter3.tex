\section*{Finite Element solution of the fiber/matrix interface crack problem: convergence properties and mode mixity of the Virtual Crack Closure Technique}

The analysis of bi-material interface cracks, such as the fiber/matrix interface crack or debond, in the context of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics hides some peculiar complexities due to the nature of the solution at the crack tip. The solution to the fiber/matrix interface crack problem can be classified into two different regimes~\cite{Paris1996,Varna1997a}: the \emph{open crack} and \emph{closed crack} solution. The distinction between the two lies in the existence of a region of contact between crack faces (contact zone) at the crack tip: if it exists, we talk about a \emph{closed crack} solution, otherwise of an \emph{open crack} solution.\\
The \emph{open crack} solution to the straight bi-material interface crack problem was first proposed by Williams~\cite{Williams1959}, who found the existence of an oscillatory singularity in the stress field at the crack tip of the form

\begin{equation}\label{chap3:paperA:eq:singularitywilliams}
r^{-\frac{1}{2}}\sin\left(\varepsilon\log r\right)\quad\text{with}\quad\varepsilon=\frac{1}{2\pi}\log\left(\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}\right),
\end{equation}

in both Mode I and Mode II. In Eq.~\ref{chap3:paperA:eq:singularitywilliams}, $\beta$ is one of the two parameters introduced by Dundurs~\cite{Dundurs1969} to characterize bi-material interfaces:

\begin{equation}\label{chap3:paperA:eq:dundursbeta}
\beta=\frac{\mu_{2}\left(\kappa_{1}-1\right)-\mu_{1}\left(\kappa_{2}-1\right)}{\mu_{2}\left(\kappa_{1}+1\right)+\mu_{1}\left(\kappa_{2}+1\right)}
\end{equation}

where $\kappa=3-4\nu$ in plane strain and $\kappa=\frac{3-4\nu}{1+\nu}$ in plane stress, $\mu$ is the shear modulus, $\nu$ Poisson's coefficient, and indexes $1,2$ refer to the two bulk materials joined at the interface. Due to the nature of singular solution at the crack tip in the \emph{open crack} case, the definition of Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) $\lim_{r\rightarrow 0}\sqrt{2\pi r}\sigma$ diverges and is not anymore valid~\cite{Comninou1990}. The mismatch in the value of the elastic properties at the bi-material interface makes the configuration a mixed-mode one, but the Mode mixity problem at the crack tip is ill-posed. For the same reason, Mode I and Mode II Energy Release Rate do not converge. A way to circumvent the problem is to evaluate the ERR over a finite instead of an infinitesimal crack increment, which leads naturally to the application of the Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT)~\cite{Rybicki1977,Krueger2004}.\\
The introduction of a finite crack increment makes the ERR sensitive to the mesh. Several authors have investigated the mesh sensitivity of the VCCT used in conjunction with the Finite Element Method (FEM) in the context of the straight bi-material interface crack~\cite{Krueger2013,Sun1987,Sun1989,Manoharan1990,Raju1988,Agrawal2006,Wang2013} and found that: the total Energy Release Rate $G_{TOT}$ does not depend on the mesh size; for a crack under mixed-mode behavior (\emph{open crack} case), Mode I and Mode II depend on the size of the mesh at the crack tip and do not show convergence. The purpose of this first paper is to analyze the mesh dependency of Energy Release Rate in the case of the fiber/matrix interface crack.

\end{figure}

The 1-step VCCT in the force-displacement formulation~\cite{Krueger2004} is considered and applied to the evaluation of the ERR of a debond located on a single fiber placed in a square matrix cell, as shown in Figure~\ref{chap3:paperA:fig:modelschem}. The cell has a size of $2L\times2L$, where

\begin{equation}\label{chap3:paperA:eq:LVf}
L=\frac{R_{f}}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{V_{f}}},
\end{equation}

$V_{f}$ is the fiber volume fraction and $R_{f}$ is the fiber radius, assumed to be equal to $1\ \mu m$. The occurrence of a contact zone after a critical size of the debond is considered and a contact pair interaction is established between crack faces. The interaction is considered frictionless. As the model is symmetric with respect to the $x$-axis (see Figure~\ref{chap3:paperA:fig:modelschem}), only half of it is explicitly modeled and symmetry conditions are applied to the lower boundary. A constant $x$-strain of $1\%$ is applied to the right and left boundary. Glass fiber and epoxy are considered and their properties are reported in Table~\ref{chap3:paperA:tab:phaseprop}.

The main parameter of the mesh sensitivity study is the angular size $\delta$ of the elements at the crack tip, as shown in Figure~\ref{chap3:paperA:fig:vcctmesh}.

It is found in Paper A that

\begin{itemize}
\item the total Ener is invariant to rotations of the reference frame (and more in general to linear transformations), which implies that rotation of crack tip forces and displacement is actually not required in the use of the VCCT for the calculation of $G_{TOT}$;
\item the total ERR does not depend on the size $\delta$ of the elements at the crack tip, at least for reasonably small elements ($\delta\leq1.0^{\circ}$) ;
\item as a consequence, Mode II ERR for the \emph{closed} interface crack does not depend on $\delta$, as $G_{II}=G_{TOT}$ after the onset of the contact zone;
\item for the \emph{open} interface crack, Mode I and Mode II ERR depend on the element size $\delta$ through a logarithmic law of the type $A\left(\Delta\theta\right)\ln\delta+B\left(\Delta\theta\right)$, as shown in Figure~\ref{chap3:paperA:fig:gIinterp} and Figure~\ref{chap3:paperA:fig:gIIinterp};
\item the sign of the logarithm is always positive for $G_{I}$ (see Figure~\ref{chap3:paperA:fig:gIinterp}), i.e. it decreases when $\delta$ decreases, and negative for $G_{II}$ (see Figure~\ref{chap3:paperA:fig:gIIinterp}), i.e. it increases when $\delta$ decreases.

\section*{Energy release rate of the fiber/matrix interface crack in UD composites under transverse loading: effect of the fiber volume fraction and of the distance to the free surface and to non-adjacent debonds}

In Paper B, fiber/matrix interface crack growth is studied in Representative Volume Elements of UD composites subjected to transverse loading. A unit cell constituted by one fiber and the surrounding matrix, shown in Figure~\ref{chap3:paperB:fig:modelschem}, represents the basic element of the RVE.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{paperB/RUC.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic of the reference unit cell with its main parameters.}\label{chap3:paperB:fig:modelschem}
\end{figure}

The unit cell has a size of $2L\times2L$, where

\begin{equation}\label{chap3:paperB:eq:LVf}
L=\frac{R_{f}}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{V_{f}}},
\end{equation}

$R_{f}$ is the fiber radius, assumed to be equal to $1\ \mu m$, and $V_{f}$ is the fiber volume fraction. Notice that the value of $1\ \mu m$ for the fiber radius is arbitrary and chosen for simplicity: in the context of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), the Energy Release Rate (ERR) is directly proportional to the fiber radius, thus evaluation of the ERR for another value requires simply a multiplication.\\
The RVE is made up by $n$ unit cells as the one of Figure~\ref{chap3:paperB:fig:modelschem} in the horizontal (loading) direction and $k$ unit cells in the vertical (through-the-thickness) direction (see Figure~\ref{chap3:paperB:fig:thickply}). The fiber of the unit cell placed in the center of the RVE is always partially debonded, and the debond has an angular size $\Delta\theta$ which can vary between $10^{\circ}$ and $150^{\circ}$.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{paperB/thickPly.pdf}
    \caption{Multiple rows of fibers with a debond appearing every $n$ fibers within the central row: model $n\times k-free$ ($n=3$ and $k=3$ in the figure).}\label{chap3:paperB:fig:thickply}
\end{figure}

The RVE is symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis ($x$-axis), thus only half of it is explicitly modelled and conditions of symmetry are applied on the lower boundary of the RVE. On the left and right boundaries, conditions of coupling of the $x$-displacement (horizontal displacement) are applied. This implies that the computed solution corresponds to the RVE repeating an infinite number of times to the left and to the right symmetrically with the respect to the side boundary, i.e. if the debond in the central unit cell is placed on the right side of the fiber, then the next one to the right and to the left is on the left side, the successive one is on the right, and so on. As a consequence, the number $n$ of unit cells in the horizontal direction determines the distance between consecutive debonds in the horizontal direction, which corresponds to the $n-1$ fully bonded fibers. The upper and lower boundaries (but, given the symmetry with respect to the $x$-axis, only the upper one is explicitly modeled) are left free. Thus, the family of RVEs studied in this paper is called $n\times k-free$.\\
A constant $x$-strain equal to $1\%$ is applied to the left and right boundary. The selected value of $1\%$ is arbitrary, as in LEFM the ERR is proportional to the square of the strain. Thus, the value of the ERR for another level of applied strain can calculated with a multiplication. Contact between debond faces is considered frictionless. The fiber and matrix phases, respectively glass fiber and epoxy, are considered to be homogeneous, isotropic and linear elastic. Their material properties are reported in Table~\ref{chap3:paperB:tab:phaseprop}.

\end{table}

The model is meshed with second order quadrilateral and triangular elements, while at the crack tip only second order quadrilateral elements are used with unitary aspect ratio, determined by the arc size $R_{f}\delta$ where $\delta$ is the angular size. Given the results on convergence of Paper A, the angular size $\delta$ of the elements at the crack tip is determined here by comparison with the Boundary Element Method (BEM) results provided in~\cite{Paris2007,Sandino2016} for a single debonded fiber in an infinite matrix. The comparison is conducted using the $1\times1-free$ RVE with $V_{f}=0.0079$, which corresponds to $L\sim100 R_{f}$. A trade-off between accuracy and computational cost (time and memory required for the solution) is found for $\delta=0.05^{\circ}$. A comparison between the ERR computed with $\delta=0.05^{\circ}$ and the BEM results is shown in Figure~\ref{chap3:paperB:fig:validation}. The error between FEM and BEM solution does not exceed $5\%$ for any value of $\Delta\theta$. This provides a measure of the accuracy of the results proposed here: differences between values of ERR smaller than $5\%$ should not be taken into consideration.

\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item With a decreasing number of fully bonded fibers between two partially debonded fibers in the central row, the ERR decreases. It seems to exist a characteristic distance between debonds which defines the transition to a non-interactive solution. However, this distance depends on the number of perfectly bonded fiber rows surrounding the central row and on the fiber volume fraction. This distance can be estimated to be around $100$ fully bonded fibers for a 1-fiber-row thick UD with $V_{f}=30\%$ and $200$ for a 1-fiber-row thick UD with $V_{f}=60\%$, while it is expected to be around $100$ fibers for a 5-fibers-row thick UD with $V_{f}=60\%$.
\item The presence of a free surface close to the debond leads to higher Mode I and Mode II ERRs and a shift of the peak $G$ values to larger debonds.
\item The presence of fibers (fully or partially bonded) in the composite thickness direction, along the same vertical line as the analyzed central fiber, appears to have a restraining effect on both $G_{I}$ and $G_{II}$. The free composite surface effect on the ERR decays very fast: adding more than $2$ fully bonded fibers below and above the central row leads to stable constant values of ERR.
\item The presence of a debond in the fiber above the central partially debonded one only delays the appearance of the contact zone, while no significant effect on the ERR has been observed.
\item Increasing the fiber content (decreasing the inter-fiber distance), magnifies in general the effects described in the previous points.
\item The results and conclusions presented agree well with previous observations reported in the literature~\cite{Sandino2016,Zhuang2018}. A mechanical explanation of the observed trends has been presented based on the mismatch in elastic properties, particularly Poisson's ratios, and the positions of fibers and debonds with respect to the loading direction.
