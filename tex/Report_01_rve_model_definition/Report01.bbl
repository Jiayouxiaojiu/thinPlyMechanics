  Abstract Transverse cracking in cross-ply carbon/epoxy and glass/epoxy
  laminates in tension is analyzed by means of computational micromechanics.
  Longitudinal plies were modeled as homogenized, anisotropic elastic solids
  while the actual fiber distribution was included in the transverse plies. The
  mechanical response was obtained by the finite element analysis of a long
  representative volume element of the laminate. Damage in the transverse plies
  was triggered by interface decohesion and matrix cracking. The simulation
  strategy was applied to study the influence of ply thickness on the critical
  stress for the cracking of the transverse plies and on the evolution of crack
  density in 0 2 / 90 n / 2 s laminates, with n = 1, 2, 4 and 8. It was found
  that the transverse ply strength corresponding to the initiation and
  propagation of a through-thickness crack was independent of the ply thickness
  and that the transverse strength of carbon/epoxy laminates was 35\% higher
  than that of the glass fiber counterparts. In addition, the mechanisms of
  crack initiation and propagation through the thickness as well as of multiple
  matrix cracking were ascertained and the stiffness reduction in the 90Â° ply
  as a function of crack density was computed as a function of the ply
  thickness.%
