The method is motivated by the cracking-particle method (Rabczuk T., Belytschko T., International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 2004) where the crack is modeled by a set of cracked segments. However, in contrast to the above mentioned paper, we do not introduce additional unknowns in the variational formulation to capture the displacement discontinuity. Instead, the crack is modeled by splitting particles located on opposite sides of the associated crack segments and we make use of the visibility method in order to describe the crack kinematics. We apply this method to several two- and three-dimensional problems in statics and dynamics and show through several numerical examples that the method does not show any \&ldquo;mesh\&rdquo; orientation bias.},

	abstract = {Considerable progress has been achieved in fractal characterization of the properties of crack surfaces in quasibrittle materials such as concrete, rock, ice, ceramics and composites. Recently, fractality of cracks or microcracks was proposed as the explanation of the observed size effect on the nominal strength of structures. This explanation, though, has rested merely on intuitive analogy and geometric reasoning, and did not take into account the mechanics of crack propagation. In this paper, the energy-based asymptotic analysis of scaling presented in the preceding companion paper in this issue [1] is extended to the effect of fractality on scaling. First, attention is focused on the propagation of fractal crack curves (invasive fractals). The modifications of the scaling law caused by crack fractality are derived, both for quasibrittle failures after large stable crack growth and for failures at the initiation of a fractal crack in the boundary layer near the surface. Second, attention is focused on discrete fractal distribution of microcracks (lacunar fractals), which is shown to lead to an analogy withWeibull\&rsquo;s statistical theory of size effect due to material strength randomness. The predictions ensuing from the fractal hypothesis, either invasive or lacunar, disagree with the experimentally confirmed asymptotic characteristics of the size effect in quasibrittle structures. It is also pointed out that considering the crack curve as a self-similar fractal conflicts with kinematics. This can be remedied by considering the crack to be an affine fractal. It is concluded that the fractal characteristics of either the fracture surface or the microcracking at the fracture front cannot have a significant influence on the law of scaling of failure loads, although they can affect the fracture characteristics.},

	abstract = {A progressive failure analysis method has been developed for predicting the failure of laminated composite structures under geometrically nonlinear deformations. The progressive failure analysis uses C1 shell elements based on classical lamination theory to calculate the in-plane stresses. Several failure criteria, including the maximum strain criterion, Hashin's criterion, and Christensen's criterion, are used to predict the failure mechanisms and several options are available to degrade the material properties after failures. The progressive failure analysis method is implemented in the COMET finite element analysis code and can predict the damage and response of laminated composite structures from initial loading to final failure. The different failure criteria and material degradation methods are compared and assessed by performing analyses of several laminated composite structures. Results from the progressive failure method indicate good correlation with the existing test data except in structural applications where interlaminar stresses are important which may cause failure mechanisms such as debonding or delaminations.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the implementation of an efficient Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation for the three dimensional finite element modeling of mode I self-similar dynamic fracture process. Contrary to the remeshing technique, the presented algorithm can continuously advance the crack with the one mesh topology. The uncoupled approach is employed to treat the equations. So, each time step is split into two phases: an updated Lagrangian phase followed by an Eulerian phase. The implicit time integration method is applied for solving the transient problem in Lagrangian phase with no convective effects. A mesh motion scheme, in which the related equations need not to be solved at every time step, is proposed in Eulerian phase. The critical dynamic stress intensity factor criterion is used to determine the crack velocity. The variation of dynamic stress intensity factor along the crack front is also studied based on the interaction integral method. The proposed algorithm is applied to investigate the dynamic crack propagation in the DCB specimen subjected to fixed displacement. The predicted results are compared with the experimental study cited in the literature and a good agreement is shown. The proposed algorithm leads to the accurate and efficient analysis of dynamic crack propagation process.},

For unidirectional composites, the strength is governed by the axial, transverse, and shear strengths, and the angle of fiber orientation. The strength of a laminated composite consisting of layers of uni-directional composites depends on the strength, thickness, and orientation of each constituent layer and the temperature at which the laminate is cured. In the process of lamination, thermal and mechanical interactions are induced which affect the residual stress and the subsequent stress distribution under external load. A method of strength analysis of laminated composites is delineated using glass-epoxy composites as examples. The validity of the method is demonstrated by appropriate experiments.

A new phase, called the \&lsquo;third world-wide failure exercise\&rsquo; is currently underway to fill some of the major gaps identified in the previous activities. The third world-wide failure exercise is concerned with highlighting the degree of maturity of the current capabilities of 12 internationally recognised methods for modelling various aspects of damage in composite materials. Such problems include matrix cracks due to thermal and mechanical loads; delamination; ply constraint and stacking sequence effects; loading and unloading phenomena; failure due to stress gradients (in particular the hole size effect). The topics addressed within the third world-wide failure exercise represent an extremely important and crucial area for advanced modelling and virtual testing of composites. The third world-wide failure exercise runs in two stages (1) Part A which is devoted to providing full details and a comparison between the 12 theories together with their \&lsquo;blind\&rsquo; predictions, made by their originators, for a challenging set of test problems and (2) Part B which is concerned with comparing the theoretical predictions with experimental results and assessing the accuracy and maturity of the methods.

The dimensionless formulation brings out the parameters synthetically controlling the structural behavior and the size-scale effects. Different scaling transitions are predicted in the flexural behavior of the composite depending on different modeling of the toughening mechanisms. When a homogenized toughening mechanism for the whole composite is considered along with closing tractions as a linearly decreasing function of the crack opening displacement, a ductile to brittle transition is found as the beam depth increases. On the other hand, when the matrix toughness and the toughening mechanism of the reinforcements are separately modeled, and the closing tractions have a constant value until a critical crack opening displacement, a double brittle-ductile-brittle transition is found. Experimental tests on fiber-reinforced mortar beams in bending are successfully simulated.},

They provide a rational interpretation to a majority of empirical power-law criteria used in fatigue. In particular, they are able to model the effects of the grain size, of the initial crack length, as well as of the size-scale of the tested specimen on the crack growth rate and on the fatigue life. Regarding the important issue of crack-size dependencies of the Paris\&rsquo; coefficient C and of the fatigue threshold, an independent approach, based on the application of fractal geometry concepts, is proposed to model such an anomalous behavior. As a straightforward consequence of the fractality of the crack surfaces, the fractal approach provides scaling laws fully consistent with those determined from dimensional analysis arguments. The proposed scaling laws are applied to relevant experimental data related to the crack-size and to the structural-size dependencies of the fatigue parameters in metals and in quasi-brittle materials. Finally, paying attention to the limit points defining the range of validity of the classical W\"{o}hler and Paris power-law relationships, correlations between the so-called cyclic or fatigue properties are proposed, giving a rational explanation to the experimental trends observed in the material property charts.},

The most common damage mode and the one examined in this work is intralaminar cracking in layers. The crack opening displacement (COD) and the crack sliding displacement (CSD) during loading reduce the average stress in the damaged layer, thus reducing the laminate stiffness. These parameters depend on material properties of the damaged layer and surrounding layers, on layer orientation and thickness. Previously these parameters have been calculated using finite element method (FEM) assuming linear elastic material with idealized geometry of cracks. To validate these assumptions experimentally the displacement field on the surface of a [90/0/90] carbon fiber/epoxy laminate specimens with multiple intralaminar cracks in the surface layer is studied and the COD dependence on the applied mechanical load is measured. The specimen full-field displacement measurement is carried out using ESPI (Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry). The displacement jumps corresponding to cracks are clearly visible and can be used to determine the opening displacement along the cracks.

	abstract = {The macroscopic failure of composite laminates subjected to tensile increasing load is preceded by initiation and evolution of several microdamage modes. The most common damage mode and the one examined in this thesis is intralaminar cracking in layers. Due to this kind of microdamage the laminate undergoes stiffness reduction when loaded in tension. The degradation of the elastic properties of these materials is caused by reduced stress in the damaged layer which is mainly due to two parameters: crack opening displacement (COD) and crack sliding displacement (CSD). The first objective of this thesis is to investigate the effect of crack interaction on COD using FEM and to describe the identified dependence on crack density in a simple and accurate form by introducing an interaction function dependent on crack density. The application of this function to more complex laminate lay-ups is demonstrated. All these calculations are performed assuming that cracks are equidistant. Using FEM, we assume linear elastic material with ideal crack geometry. Fiber bridging over the crack surface is possible which can affect COD and CSD. The only correct way to validate these assumptions is through experiments. The second objective is to measure these parameters for different laminate lay-ups in this way providing models with valuable information for validation of used assumptions and for defining limits of their application. In particular, the displacement field on the edge of a [90/0]s and [903/0]s carbon fiber/epoxy laminates specimens with multiple intralaminar cracks in the surface layer is studied.},

In this work, carbon-epoxy composites of different ply thicknesses (30g/m2, 100g/m2 and 300g/m2 fiber areal weight) were produced from the same batch of Toray M40JB fiber and NorthTPT TP80ep matrix to study the influence of ply thickness on the ultimate strength and onset of damage of lamina and quasi isotropic laminates. Characterization tests on unidirectional lamina showed only limited influence of the ply thickness on the elastic and ultimate strength properties except for longitudinal compression in which the thinner ply specimens showed some advantage because of a more uniform microstructure. Uniaxial tension, open-hole compression and open-hole tensile fatigue tests on quasi isotropic [45°/90°/-45°/0°]ns laminates showed however very significant improvements of on-set of damage, and in some cases ultimate strength, when decreasing the ply thickness..These performance improvements could be related to a major change in the damage progression and failure modes of the laminates caused by a systematic delay or near suppression of transverse cracking and delamination growth in thin-ply composites. Detailed meso-scale finite element models of quasi isotropic unnotched tensile tests were developed and demonstrated that the increased stability of transverse intralaminar cracks was the main cause of the improved onset of damage of thin ply composites.},

	abstract = {This study analyzes fiber tensile and matrix shear stresses near the crack tip in a transversely cracked, unidirectional, fiber-reinforced lamina under a remote tensile stress applied in the fiber direction. The two-dimensional lamina consists of parallel, equally-spaced elastic fibers with elastic matrix in-between, and contains a row of up to a few hundred contiguous fiber breaks aligned transverse to the fiber direction forming a central transverse crack. Using the break-influence superposition (BIS) technique, a recently developed method for analyzing a shear-lag model first introduced by Hedgepeth, we calculate the tensile and shear stress concentrations in the fibers and matrix, respectively. These are compared to tensile and shear stresses calculated using Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) and the complete elasticity solution both for the continuum limit of a homogeneous, orthotropic elastic material with a transverse central crack loaded in Mode I. For the shear-lag model a critical scaling parameter for examining the stress behavior away from the crack tip along the fiber direction is v E*/G*, where E* and G* are composite in-plane stiffness constants along the fiber direction and in shear, respectively. In addition to these parameters, the LEFM and complete elasticity solutions also involve the effective transverse stiffness and Poisson's ratio. For a sizable crack (consisting of 100 or more fiber breaks), the fiber tensile stresses ahead of the crack tip along the crack plane calculated from the BIS approach achieve excellent agreement with the LEFM solution down to the scale of one fiber diameter and even better agreement with the complete solution both in the near crack tip field and far field, regardless of the composite stiffness constants. The profiles of the fiber tensile and matrix shear stresses along the fiber direction show generally good agreement, with the agreement improving as the composite stiffness transverse to the fiber direction grows.},

The initiation and propagation of transverse cracks have been a long standing issue in the last few decades. In this paper, a three-dimensional stress analysis method based on the state space approach is used to compute the stresses, including the inter-laminar stresses near transverse cracks in laminated composites. The stress field is then used to estimate the energy release rate, from which the initiation and propagation of transverse cracking are predicted. The proposed method is illustrated by numerical solutions and is validated by available experimental results.

The new two-dimensional stress analysis is used to calculate the total strain energy, effective modulus, and longitudinal thermal expansion coefficient for a laminate having microcracks and delaminations. These results are used to calculate the energy release rate for the initiation and growth of a delamination induced by a matrix microcrack. At low crack densities, [(S)/90 n] s laminates are expected to fail by microcracking and to show little or no delamination. At some critical crack density, which is a function of laminate structure and material properties, the energy release rate for delamination exceeds that for microcracking and delamination is predicted to dominate over microcracking. A quasi-three-dimensional model is used to predict the propagation of arbitrarily shaped delamination fronts. All predictions agree with experimental observations.},

	abstract = {Isogeometric analysis (IGA) represents a recently developed technology in computational mechanics that offers the possibility of integrating methods for analysis and Computer Aided Design (CAD) into a single, unified process. The implications to practical engineering design scenarios are profound, since the time taken from design to analysis is greatly reduced, leading to dramatic gains in efficiency. In this manuscript, through a self-contained Matlab® implementation, we present an introduction to IGA applied to simple analysis problems and the related computer implementation aspects. Furthermore, implementation of the extended IGA which incorporates enrichment functions through the partition of unity method (PUM) is also presented, where several examples for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional fracture are illustrated. We also describe the use of IGA in the context of strong-form (collocation) formulations, which has been an area of research interest due to the potential for significant efficiency gains offered by these methods. The code which accompanies the present paper can be applied to one, two and three-dimensional problems for linear elasticity, linear elastic fracture mechanics, structural mechanics (beams/plates/shells including large displacements and rotations) and Poisson problems with or without enrichment. The B\'{e}zier extraction concept that allows the FE analysis to be performed efficiently on T-spline geometries is also incorporated. The article includes a summary of recent trends and developments within the field of IGA.},

@mastersthesis{MohamedLoukil2011,
	abstract = {The macroscopic failure of composite laminates subjected to tensile increasing load is preceded by initiation and evolution of several microdamage modes. The most common damage mode and the one examined in this thesis is intralaminar cracking in layers. Due to this kind of microdamage the laminate undergoes stiffness reduction when loaded in tension. For example, the elastic modulus in the loading direction and the corresponding Poisson\&rsquo;s ratio will decrease. The degradation of the elastic properties of these materials is caused by reduced stress in the damaged layer which is mainly due to two parameters: crack opening displacement (COD) and crack sliding displacement (CSD). At fixed applied load these parameters depend on the properties of the damaged and surrounding layers, on layer orientation and on thickness. When the number of cracks per unit length is high (high crack density in the layer) the COD and CSD are reduced because of to crack interaction. The main objective of the first paper is to investigate the effect of crack interaction on COD using FEM and to describe the identified dependence on crack density in a simple and accurate form by introducing an interaction function dependent on crack density. This interaction function together with COD of non-interactive crack gives accurate predictions of the damaged laminate thermo-elastic properties. The application of this function to more complex laminate lay-ups is demonstrated. All these calculations are performed assuming that cracks are equidistant. However, the crack distribution in the damaged layer is very non-uniform, especially in the initial stage of multiple cracking. In the second paper, the earlier developed model for general symmetric laminates is generalized to account for non-uniform crack distribution. This model is used to calculate the axial modulus of cross-ply laminates with cracks in internal and surface layers. In parametric analysis the COD and CSD are calculated using FEM, considering the smallest versus the average crack spacing ratio as non-uniformity parameter. It is shown that assuming uniform distribution we obtain lower bond to elastic modulus. A \&ldquo;double-periodic\&rdquo; approach presented to calculate the COD of a crack in a non-uniform case as the average of two solutions for periodic crack systems is very accurate for cracks in internal layers, whereas for high crack density in surface layers it underestimates the modulus reduction. In the third paper, the thermo-elastic constants of damaged laminates were calculated using shear lag models and variational models in a general calculation approach (GLOB-LOC) for symmetric laminates with transverse cracks in 90° layer. The comparison of these two models with FEM was presented for cross-ply and quasi-isotropic laminates. },

Compact Tension (CT) tests were performed in four different ply thickness laminates, from the same material and laminate thickness. Testing was monitored with digital image correlation (DIC). The compliance and area methods were considered to perform the data-reduction scheme. A 2-D macro-scale finite element (FE) model was built and crack propagation was simulated using a layer of cohesive elements. The load-displacement curve predicted by simulations was compared with experimental values. Moreover, bridging length, crack length and damage onset were also investigated. Fracture surface and through-the-thickness damage observations were also performed. The study performed in this thesis showed that composite laminates show a brittle behavior, when decreasing the ply thickness.

	abstract = {Granular materials have a multiphase behaviour as they can behave like solids, fluids or gases. They appear in many industrial applications such as food processing or pharmaceutics and also in geotechnical and -physical phenomena like avalanches. This study considers a test-problem where a granular jet impinges on an inclined plane resulting in a hydraulic shock enclosing a region of thin fast-flowing flow. Such an impingement has been studied extensively with experiments and finite volume methods. However, the applied model lacks the full details of the three-dimensional flow near, e.g. the impingement zone due to the assumption that the flow satisfies the depth-averaged granular shallow flow equations in all regions. The discrete particle method (DPM) is able to provide the fully three-dimensional details for the flow in all regions which is the reason for choosing this method. The simulations are performed with an open source DPM solver, Mercury, which is developed within the Multi Scale Mechanics group and modified to capture the problem. This method simulates the movement of individual particles over many time-steps, where the movement of the particles changes due to collisions with other particles or objects. The three-dimensional discrete results are interactively examined with an OpenGL based software package, VMD, which has been extended and adapted for the analysis of DPM. The discrete results are also coarse grained to obtain continuous fields for all regions including those where the earlier finite volume results, which are based on the granular shallow flow equations, could not reproduce the experimental observations. Visual observations of the discrete results, for the set of parameters used, indicate that the flow differs from earlier experimental work in the strength of the hydraulic jump and the down-slope velocity of the flow outside the enclosed region. These differences are closer investigated with the coarse graining method which is subjected to a sensibility study and checked for compatibility with continuity. Analysis on the influence of system parameters like the falling height and inclination angle are consistent with some of the earlier work. However, discrepancies in the shape of the enclosed region are encountered and the height-velocity graphs confirm the weakness of the hydraulic jump, due to insufficient mass flux in the system, which is limited by CPU-power. Furthermore, on the theoretical side, dimensionless numbers such as the Knudsen number are calculated to validate the assumptions made in the derivation of the granular shallow flow equations and another example of such dimensionless number is the Froude number which is necessary for the characterisation of the dilute enclosed region. Irrespective of the stated differences, DPM is able to model such a complex flow on a detailed level. Nevertheless, for a higher mass flux, the computational time has to be reduced by parallelisation to describe the flow behaviour in the interesting high mass flux regime. Profiling of the applied solver and a preliminary study on the application of the OpenMP method on the existing open source solver showed that this parallelisation method on its own will not result in a significant speed-up. A combination of MPI and OpenMP parallelisation is therefore advised.},

The lectures of this course formed the basis for this book. Its aim is to impart fundamental knowledge of the underlying theories of the different approaches for modelling cracking of concrete and to provide a critical survey of the state-of-the-art in computational concrete mechanics. This book covers a relatively broad spectrum of topics related to modelling of cracks, including continuum-based and discrete crack models, meso-scale models, advanced discretization strategies to capture evolving cracks based on the concept of finite elements with embedded discontinuities and on the extended finite element method, respectively, and, last but not least, extensions to coupled problems such as hygro-mechanical problems as required in computational durability analyses of concrete structures.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the use of a continuum damage model to predict strength and size effects in notched carbon\&ndash;epoxy laminates. The effects of size and the development of a fracture process zone before final failure are identified in an experimental program. The continuum damage model is described and the resulting predictions of size effects are compared with alternative approaches: the point stress and the inherent flaw models, the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics approach, and the strength of materials approach. The results indicate that the continuum damage model is the most accurate technique to predict size effects in composites. Furthermore, the continuum damage model does not require any calibration and it is applicable to general geometries and boundary conditions.},

	abstract = {In this paper we use dimensional analysis as a method for solving problems in qualitative physics. We pose and solve some of the qualitative reasoning problems discussed in the literature, in the context of devices such as the pressure regulator and the heat exchanger. Using dimensional analysis, such devices or systems can be reasoned about without explicit knowledge of the physical laws that govern the operation of such devices. Instead, the method requires knowledge of the relevant physical variables and their dimensional representation. Our main thesis can be stated as follows: the dimensional representations of physical variables encode a significant amount of physical knowledge; dimensionless numbers provide a representation of the physical processes, and they can be obtained without direct, explicit knowledge of the underlying laws of physics. Then, a variety of partial derivatives can be computed and used to characterize the behavior of the system. These partials, along with some simple heuristics, can be used to reason qualitatively about the behavior of devices and systems. Here we present the techniques for dimensional analysis and develop the representation and reasoning machinery.},

In this method, the crack can be arbitrarily oriented, but its growth is represented discretely by activation of crack surfaces at individual particles, so no representation of the crack's topology is needed. The crack is modelled by a local enrichment of the test and trial functions with a sign function (a variant of the Heaviside step function), so that the discontinuities are along the direction of the crack. The discontinuity consists of cylindrical planes centred at the particles in three dimensions, lines centred at the particles in two dimensions.

However, not all the material presented in that course is expounded, not only for limitations of scope but other recent sources published by the author are available. The article begins by a broad overview of the problem of size effect or scaling of failure, which has recently come to the forefront of attention in the theory of composites, in view of the efforts to design load bearing composited structures for ships and aircraft. After the overview, attention is focused on the size effect in compression failure of fiber composites occurring in the form of kink bands with fiber microbuckling. The limitations of the Weibull statistical theory of random strength are also spelled out. The presentation is accompanied by selected comparisons with test results and numerical computations.},

In the method, the growth of the actual crack is tracked and approximated with contiguous discrete crack segments that lie on finite element nodes and span only two adjacent elements. The method can deal with complicated fracture patterns because it needs no explicit representation of the topology of the actual crack path. A set of effective rules for injection of crack segments is presented so that fracture behavior beginning from arbitrary crack nucleations to macroscopic crack propagation is seamlessly modeled. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with several dynamic fracture problems that involve complicated crack patterns such as fragmentation and crack branching.},

@book{BruceAFinlayson1972,
	abstract = {This is a book for people who want to solve problems formulated as differential equations in science and engineering. The subject area is limited to fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer. While making no pretense at completely covering these subjects and their relationship to variational principles and approximate methods, the book is intended to give the novice an introduction to the subject, and lead him through the difficult research problems being treated in the current literature. The first four chapters give a relatively simple treatment of many classical problems in the field. The literature is full of simple, one-term approximations, but the method of weighted residuals (MWR) can be used to obtain answers of any desired accuracy, and there are several methods specifically adapted to the computer. Tn many test cases MWR compares favorably to finite difference computations in that the MWR results are either more accurate or require less computation time to generate or both. Chapter 4 discusses the developments by Professor D. E. Abbott and his students at Purdue University on laminar boundary layer flows. Orthogonal collocation is illustrated in Chapter 5. This method was advanced in 1967 by Professor W. E. Stewart at the University of Wisconsin and J. V. Villadsen at Danmarks Tekniske Hsjskole. It drastically reduces the drudgery of setting up the problem, and, when applicable, is highly recommended. Chapter 6 studies the Galerkin method as applied to convective instability problems, where it proves effective and accurate. Chapters 5 and 7 relate MWR to finite element methods, which is a promising technique, especially for linear problems with irregular boundaries.The ideas behind the method of weighted residuals are relatively simple and are easily applied. Variational principles are only slightly more complicated, but are often irrelevant to applications in engineering. Consequently this material takes a more appropriate back seat. Variational principles in fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer are presented in Chapters 7-9. Chapter 10 is a short summary of my opinions on the attempt to derive '' variational " principles based on a principle of minimum (or maximum) rate of entropy production. The final chapter gives a summary of results on convergence and error bounds, subjects which are rapidly expanding. While numerical convergence often suffices, the theorems in Chapter 11 give the conditions necessary to ensure convergence in difficult nonlinear problems. The book is intended to be comprehensible to a graduate student with some knowledge of and interest in mathematics through differential equations. I hope it will find use as a reference book for graduate courses discussing approximate and numerical solutions, as well as a convenient reference for those working in the field. Problem sets are included to aid in self-study and course work.One of the pleasurable aspects of writing a book, I have discovered, is that while organizing the material new results are suggested. These are scattered throughout the book so that 1 highlight them here. In the variational method the eigenvalue is stationary to small errors in the approximate eigenfunctions. I show that this is also true of the Galerkin method (Chapter 6). While not a new result, Section 7.8 illustrates two very simple and practical methods of obtaining lower bounds on eigenvalues. A variational principle is given for a collection of fluid drops suspended in another fluid in slow flow-extending the previous results for Newtonian fluids in both phases to allow non-Newtonian fluids in both phases. The nonexistence of a variational principle for the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations is shown in Section 8.6 using Frechet differentials, making more concise the detailed arguments given in 1930 by C. B. Millikan. Indeed the Frechet derivative proves useful in organizing the many variational principles, or lack of them, in heat and mass transfer (see Chapter 9). The Fr\'{e}chet derivative is also used to define a variational principle for any 
differential equation and its " adjoint "-even nonlinear equations-although there appears to be no advantage to do so. One of the difficulties with M WR or variational methods is that the error is often not known. Some of the methods discussed above are specifically designed to allow the results to be carried to numerical convergence. Even so, it is of interest to have some rigorous definition of the error. The residual -the equation which is solved only approximately-provides such a criteria. Material in Section 11.6, largely developed by one of my students, Noble Ferguson, gives error bounds on the solution in terms of error bounds on the residual. Thus the error can be assessed when the exact solution is unknown. The residual also proves a useful guide in cases where the appropriate theorems have not yet been proved.The review of the literature is complete to October, 1970},

	Empirically, we emphasize that the growth has been driven by the
	consumption of services. Rather than being driven by low-skill jobs,
	the importance of skill-intensive services has risen, and this has
	coincided with a period of rising relative wages and quantities of
	high-skilled labor. We develop a theory where demand shifts toward
	ever more skill-intensive output as income rises, and because skills
	are highly specialized this lowers the importance of home production
	relative to market services. The theory is also consistent with a
	rising level of skill and skill premium, a rising relative price
	of services that is linked to this skill premium, and rich product
	cycles between home and market, all of which are observed in the
	data.},

	mechanics models of matrix cracks are used to develop a criterion
	for matrix failure in tension and to calculate the associated in
	situ strengths. The LaRC03 criteria are applied to a few examples
	to predict failure load envelopes and to predict the failure mode
	for each region of the envelope. The analysis results are compared
	to the predictions using other available failure criteria and with

	abstract = {{We consider continuous media in which contact edge forces are present.
	Introducing the notion of quasi- balanced contact force distribution,
	we are able to prove the conjectures made in [Noll, 1990] concerning
	the representation of contact edge forces. We first generalise the
	Noll theorem on Cauchy postulate. Then we adapt the celebrated Cauchy
	tetrahedron construction to find a representation theorem for stress
	states. Moreover we find the relationship between double forces Germain
	[Germain, 1973a,b], interstitial working [Dunn, 1985] and contact
	edge forces.}},

	abstract = {This report documents the results of a Federal Aviation Administration
	Cooperative Agreement with Edmonds Community College to develop a
	standard for teaching an introductory course on critical composite
	maintenance and repair issues. The course will serve as an introduction
	and provide an awareness of safety issues regarding the maintenance
	and repair of composite materials used in aerospace. The course will
	also provide a background for further study for those interested
	in becoming qualified practitioners. This course is intended for
	engineers, technicians, inspectors, and other personnel involved
	with the maintenance and repair of composite structures.
	
	The framework for the awareness course is defined by Terminal Course
	Objectives, which are summarized further into terminal course modules.
	The four main areas at the highest outline level include base knowledge,
	teamwork and disposition, damage detection and characterization,
	and repair processes. Content includes text, laboratory instructions,
	and videos in support of the course objectives. Materials for evaluating
	the effectiveness of the course content in meeting the standards
	represented in this report are provided with reference to industry
	documents, especially CACRC AIR report 5719, which provides a checklist
	of detailed teaching points. An instructor�s guide is also included
	to assist in developing the course. Additionally, several collaborative
	workshops and other forums that were held during the development
	process, involving industry, academia, and government regulatory
	agencies are described.},

@article{Koenderink1984,
	abstract = {In practice the relevant details of images exist only over a restricted
	range of scale. Hence it is important to study the dependence of
	image structure on the level of resolution. It seems clear enough
	that visual perception treats images on several levels of resolution
	simultaneously and that this fact must be important for the study
	of perception. However, no applicable mathematically formulated theory
	to deal with such problems appers to exist. In this paper it is shown
	that any image can be embedded in a one-parameter family of derived
	images (with resolution as the parameter) in essentially only one
	unique way if the constraint that no spurious detail should be generated
	when the resolution is diminished, is applied. The structure of this
	family is governed by the well known diffusion equation (a parabolic,
	linear, partial differential equation of the second order). As such
	the structure fits into existing theories that treat the front end
	of the visual system as a continuous tack of homogeneous layer, characterized
	by iterated local processing schemes. When resolution is decreased
	the images becomes less articulated because the extrem ( light and
	dark blobs ) disappear one after the other. This erosion of structure
	is a simple process that is similar in every case. As a result any
	image can be described as a juxtaposed and nested set of light and
	dark blobs, wherein each blod has a limited range of resolution in
	which it manifests itself. The structure of the family of derived
	images permits a derivation of the sampling density required to sample
	the image at multiple scales of resolution. The natural scale along
	the resolution axis (leading to an informationally uniform sampling
	density) is logarithmic, thus the structure is apt for the description
	of size invariances.},

@article{Shet2002,
	abstract = {Cohesive Zone Models (CZMs) are being increasingly used to simulate
	fracture and fragmentation processes in metallic, polymeric, and
	ceramic materials and their composites. Instead of an infinitely
	sharp crack envisaged in fracture mechanics, CZM presupposes the
	presence of a fracture process zone where the energy is transferred
	from external work both in the forward and the wake regions of the
	propagating crack. In this paper, we examine how the external work
	flows as recoverable elastic strain energy, inelastic strain energy,
	and cohesive energy, the latter encompassing the work of fracture
	and other energy consuming mechanisms within the fracture process
	zone. It is clearly shown that the plastic energy in the material
	surrounding the crack is not accounted in the cohesive energy. Thus
	cohesive zone energy encompasses all the inelastic energy e.g., energy
	required for grainbridging, cavitation, internal sliding, surface
	energy but excludes any form of inelastic strain energy in the bounding
	material.},

	design issues and ways of testing delamination resistance
	
	- Discuss ways of studying and modelling delamination behaviour
	
	- A standard reference for all those researching laminated composites
	
	Given such advantages as low weight compared to strength and toughness,
	laminated composites are now used in a wide range of applications.
	Their increasing use has underlined the need to understand their
	principal mode of failure, delamination. This important book reviews
	key research in understanding and preventing delamination. 
	
	The first part of the book reviews general issues such as the role
	of fracture mechanics in understanding delamination, design issues
	and ways of testing delamination resistance. Part two describes techniques
	for detecting and characterising delamination such as piezoelectric
	sensors, the use of lamb waves and acoustic emission techniques.
	The next two sections of the book discuss ways of studying and modelling
	delamination behaviour. The final part of the book reviews research
	on delamination behaviour in particular conditions such as shell
	and sandwich structures, z-pin bridging and resin bonding. 
	
	With its distinguished editor and international team of contributors,
	Delamination behaviour of composites is a standard reference for
	all those researching laminated composites and using them in such
	diverse applications as microelectronics, aerospace, marine, automotive
	and civil engineering.},

	abstract = {Abstract Transverse cracking in cross-ply carbon/epoxy and glass/epoxy laminates in tension is analyzed by means of computational micromechanics. Longitudinal plies were modeled as homogenized, anisotropic elastic solids while the actual fiber distribution was included in the transverse plies. The mechanical response was obtained by the finite element analysis of a long representative volume element of the laminate. Damage in the transverse plies was triggered by interface decohesion and matrix cracking. The simulation strategy was applied to study the influence of ply thickness on the critical stress for the cracking of the transverse plies and on the evolution of crack density in 0 2 / 90 n / 2 s laminates, with n = 1, 2, 4 and 8. It was found that the transverse ply strength corresponding to the initiation and propagation of a through-thickness crack was independent of the ply thickness and that the transverse strength of carbon/epoxy laminates was 35\% higher than that of the glass fiber counterparts. In addition, the mechanisms of crack initiation and propagation through the thickness as well as of multiple matrix cracking were ascertained and the stiffness reduction in the 90° ply as a function of crack density was computed as a function of the ply thickness. },
