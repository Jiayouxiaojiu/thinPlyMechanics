\section{Introduction}

Bi-material interfaces represent the basic load transfer mechanism at the heart of Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composite (FRPC) materials. They are present at the macroscale, in the form of adhesive joints; at the mesoscale, as interfaces between layers with different orientations; at the microscale, as fiber-matrix interfaces. Bi-material interfaces have for long attracted the attention of researchers in Fracture Mechanics~\cite{Comninou1990,Hills1993}, due to their hidden complexity.\\
The problem was first addressed in the 1950's by Williams~\cite{Williams1959}, who derived through a linear elastic asymptotic analysis the stress distribution around an \emph{open} crack (with crack faces nowhere in contact for any size of the crack) between two infinite half-planes of dissimilar materials and found the existence of a strong oscillatory behavior in the stress singularity at the crack tip of the form 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:singularitywilliams}
r^{-\frac{1}{2}}\sin\left(\varepsilon\log r\right)\quad\text{with}\quad\varepsilon=\frac{1}{2\pi}\log\left(\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}\right);
\end{equation}

in which $\beta$ is one of the two parameters introduced by Dundurs~\cite{Dundurs1969} to characterize bi-material interfaces:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dundursbeta}
\beta=\frac{\mu_{2}\left(\kappa_{1}-1\right)-\mu_{1}\left(\kappa_{2}-1\right)}{\mu_{2}\left(\kappa_{1}+1\right)+\mu_{1}\left(\kappa_{2}+1\right)}
\end{equation}

where $\kappa=3-4\nu$ in plane strain and $\kappa=\frac{3-4\nu}{1+\nu}$ in plane stress, $\mu$ is the shear modulus, $\nu$ Poisson's coefficient, and indexes $1,2$ refer to the two bulk materials joined at the interface. Defining $a$ as the length of the crack, it was found that the size of the oscillatory region is in the order of $10^{-6}a$~\cite{Erdogan1963}. Given the oscillatory behaviour of the crack tip singularity of the stress field of Eq.~\ref{eq:singularitywilliams}, the definition of Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) $\lim_{r\rightarrow 0}\sqrt{2\pi r}\sigma$ ceases to be valid as it returns logarithmically infinite terms~\cite{Comninou1990}. Furthermore, it implies that the Mode mixity problem at the crack tip is ill-posed.\\
It was furthermore observed, always in the context of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), that an interpenetration zone exists close to the crack tip~\cite{England1965,Malyshev1965} with a length in the order of $10^{-4}$~\cite{England1965}. Following conclusions firstly proposed in\cite{Malyshev1965}, the presence of a \emph{contact zone} in the crack tip neighborhood, of a length to be determined from the solution of the elastic problem, was introduced in~\cite{Comninou1977} and shown to provide a physically consistent solution to the straight bi-material interface crack problem.\\
The curved bi-material interface crack, more often refered to as the fiber-matrix interface crack (or debond) due to its relevance in FRPCs, was first treated by England~\cite{England1966} and by Perlman and Sih~\cite{Perlman1967}, who provided the analytical solution of stress and displacement fields for a circular inclusion with respectively a single debond and an arbitrary number of debonds. Building on their work, Toya~\cite{Toya1974} particularized the solution and provided the expression of the Energy Release Rate (ERR) at the crack  tip. The same problems exposed previously for the \emph{open} straight bi-material were shown to exist also for the \emph{open} fiber-matrix interface crack: the presence of strong oscillations in the crack tip singularity and crack face interpenetration after a critical initial flaw size.\footnote{For the fiber-matrix interface crack, flaw size is measured in terms of the angle $\Delta\theta$ subtended by half of the arc-crack, i.e. $a=2\Delta\theta$.}\\
In order to treat cases more complex than the single partially debonded fiber in an infinite matrix of~\cite{England1966,Perlman1967,Toya1974}, numerical studies followed. In the 1990's, Par{\'{\i}}s and collaborators~\cite{Paris1996} developed a Boundary Element Method (BEM) with the use of discontinuous singular elements at the crack tip and the Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT)~\cite{Irwin1958,Krueger2004} for the evaluation of the Energy Release Rate (ERR). They validated their results~\cite{Paris1996} with respect to Toya's analytical solution~\cite{Toya1974} and analyzed the effect of BEM interface discretization on the stress field in the neighborhood of the crack tip~\cite{DelCano1997}. Following Comninou's work on the straight crack~\cite{Comninou1977}, they furthermore recognized the importance of contact to retrieve a physical solution avoiding interpenetration~\cite{Paris1996} and studied the effect of the contact zone on debond ERR~\cite{Varna1997a}. Their algorithm was then applied to investigate the fiber-matrix interface crack under different geometrical configurations and mechanical loadings ~\cite{Paris2007,Correa2007,Correa2011,Correa2013,Correa2014,Sandino2016,Sandino2018}.
