1&\textcolor{red}{\xmark}&1&Page 8, lines 2--17&It is not clear what the word “coupling” really means within the context of the application of the boundary displacement.  For example, does the “application of the coupling of horizontal displacements ux along the left and right had sides….” Means simultaneous application of the horizontal displacement ux along the left and right hand sides…?\
Similarly, what does the statement “ coupling of the vertical displacements uz  is applied to the upper boundary…” really mean?  What were the imposed boundary conditions for this particular loading state?   Was the horizontal displacement applied simultaneously as the vertical displacement?
Linear distribution of horizontal displacement – what was the linear function for the displacement distribution used, as the choice of this will have a significant influence on the strain energy release rate.&\\

3&\textcolor{red}{\xmark}&1&Page 9, lines 35-36&The applied horizontal displacement is chosen to correspond to a horizontal strain $\varepsilon_{x} = 1\%$.  However, there is no information about the applied vertical displacement $u_{z}$ for the other load cases.&\\

4&\textcolor{red}{\xmark}&1&Figure 4&the results for $G_{I}$ for the load case $1 \times 1 – coupling$ suggest $G_{I}$ zero when $\Delta\theta > 80^{\circ}$.  This is very surprising. The load case $1 \times 1 – coupling$ involves the application of vertical displacement $u_{z}$.  Thus, with increasing value of  $\Delta\theta$, $u_{z}$ will tend to have more opening mode effect on the debond.  Thus one would expect $G_{I}$ to remain finite and positive, and to increase as $\Delta\theta$  increases beyond $45$ degrees.  Can the authors comment on this and the difference between this expectation and their results?&\\

5&\textcolor{red}{\xmark}&1&Page 16&the difference between the energy release rate (ERR) for $n = 1$ and $n = 21$ (Figures 4 and 6; and Figures 5 and 7) was attributed to “strain magnification”.  As stated in the manuscript, the case with $n = 21$ is much stiffer than that with $n = 1$. The application of the same remote strain of $\varepsilon_{x} = 1\%$ to both cases, means the net average applied remote stress would be higher for $n = 21$ than for $n = 1$.  It is well known that ERR scale with the remotely applied load or stress. Should the comparison between the two cases not be made at the same average remote applied stress (not strain)? &\\
