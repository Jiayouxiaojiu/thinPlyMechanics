\section{Introduction}

Transverse cracks (or micro- or matrix cracks) represents one of the very first damage mechanism appearing in a Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composite (FRPC). A full understanding of the factors determining its onset and propagation could lead to structural improvements aimed to delay, suppress and possibly control transverse cracking in order to increase the energy absorbing capabilities of polymer composites. Early mcroscopic observations determined that onset of transverse cracking coincides with the appearance of fiber-matrix interface cracks (also called debonds), which grow along the arc direction of the fiber until a critical size, then kink out of the interface and coalesce with other debonds to form what is macroscopically seen as a transverse crack~\cite{Bailey1981}.\\
Analytical models of a single partially debonded fiber in an infinite matrix were firstly solved by Perlman and Sih~\cite{Perlman1967}, who provided the solution in terms of stress and displacement fields, and Toya~\cite{Toya1974}, who analyzed the energy release rate at the crack tip. Numerical treatment of the problem soon followed, in particular with the Boundary Element Method (BEM) solution by Paris et al.~\cite{Paris1996}. The numerical analysis of the single fiber model allowed first to understand the importance of crack face contact in the mechanics of fiber-matrix debonding~\cite{Varna1997a}, confirming earlier results regarding the straight bi-material interface~\cite{Comninou1977}. Fiber-matrix debonding was thus investigated in models of a single fiber embedded in an effectively infinite matrix under remote tension~\cite{Paris1996} and remote compression~\cite{Correa2007}. Residual thermal stresses were also analyzed~\cite{Correa2011}. The effect of a second nearby fiber was furthermore studied under the effect of different uniaxial and biaxial tensile and compressive loads~\cite{Correa2013,Correa2014,Sandino2016,Sandino2018}. Debond growth in a hexagonal cluster of fibers embedded in an effectively homogenized UD composite was investigated by Zhuang et al.~\cite{Zhuang2018}. The interaction of two debonds facing each other on two nearby fibers was addressed in~\cite{Varna2017} for a cluster of fibers immersed in a homogenized UD, while models of kinking were developed for a single fiber~\cite{Paris2007} in an infinite matrix and a cluster of fibers in a homogenized UD~\cite{Zhuang2018a}.
