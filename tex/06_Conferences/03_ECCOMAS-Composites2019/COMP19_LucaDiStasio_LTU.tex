\noindent
The abstracts accepted for the conference will be published in the Book of Abstracts. The abstracts should briefly outline the main features, results and conclusions of the research, as well as their general significance. The abstract is one page long and has to be written in English with a Times New Roman 12 points single spaced font. Figures and tables should may be included with captions, see Figure \ref{fig:Claustre}. The figures and tables should be referred to in the text. The title should be written with all capital letters. The abstract must contain the full names and affiliations of all the authors and the e-mail address of the corresponding author. His/her name is to be underlined in the author list. References can be added as well~\cite{Barbero,Pimenta}.
